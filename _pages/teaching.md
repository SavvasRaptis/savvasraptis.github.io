Research plays a central role in my teaching, as students improve their analytical skills and master the tools of data analysis through hands-on experience in my courses. I have served as instructor of record for undergraduate courses in political methodology and graduate statistics labs, where my work was recognized by the UNC Political Science Department's Earle Wallace Award for Graduate Student Teaching. I have also served as a teaching assistant for courses in international relations and American politics at UNC, in addition to the ICPSR Summer Program, where I was a teaching assistant for a course on Bayesian modeling in the social sciences. These experiences have prepared me to offer courses in international relations, political violence, and methodology at the undergraduate and graduate levels.
